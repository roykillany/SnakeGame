# Snake Browser Game

This game is an implementation of the classic game Snake in JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To run this game open 'index.html' in your favorite web browser. (link coming soon)

## How yo Play

Move up, left, down and right to collect the snake "food" aka apples and grow your snake.
Be careful: If your snake runs into itself, the game will be over. Plus if you leave the board, it comes out on the opposite side!
EXTRA: Watch out there are bombs. Don't eat them! If you do you will lose a heart. You only have 3 hearts, if all of them are gone the game is lost. Every time you eat an apple bombs are added to the area.
